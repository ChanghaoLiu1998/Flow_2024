### Project Name flow_2024

###### Overview

This project provides a set of tools for implementing a new mathematical description of the fabric of porous and fractured media as a collection of discrete entities of different dimensions, together with a new calculus on such collections, pro-vides the essential flexibility to model fabrics of arbitrary complexity and to calculate fluid flow and material's macroscopic transport properties.. The main program of the project is `Forman_analysis_2024.m`.

This project is based on the [Forman_MATLAB](https://github.com/boompiet/Forman_MATLAB) repository by Dr Pieter Boom, with modifications and improvements to fit the specific needs of this research.

###### Main Program

The main program of this project is located in the file `Forman_analysis_2024.m`. This file contains the main script that executes the primary analysis. You can run this script in MATLAB or any compatible environment that supports `.m` files.

###### Data Files

- **`.xlsx` files**: These files contain pore statistics for **Bentheimer sandstone**, which are used for analysis within the project.
- **`.tess` files**: These files represent the initial domain models, containing the volumetric features of **Bentheimer sandstone**. These are used as input for generating the materialâ€™s fabric structure.
