###### The aim of this code is to implement a new mathematical description of the fabric of porous and fractured media as a collection of discrete entities of different dimensions, together with a new calculus on such collections, pro-vides the essential flexibility to model fabrics of arbitrary complexity and to calculate fluid flow and material's macroscopic transport properties.
###### The .xlsx files include the pore statistics of Bentheimer sandstone.
###### The .tess files are the initial domains containing volumious features of Bentheimer sandstone.
